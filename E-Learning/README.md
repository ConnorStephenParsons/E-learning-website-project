# Server Links
## GitHub
GitHub Link: https://github.coventry.ac.uk/340CT-2021OCTJAN/parson67-sem1.git

I have added both Mark Tyers and Chris Bass as read only collaborators to my repository. 

Please note that All branch creations, file adding, commiting, origin addition, and pushing has been done locally on the command line, however pull requests, issues and feature branch merging for version control has been completed on the GitHub server remote repository.

Also note, In the grading rubric, it says that No commits can be made to master branch, however, After I installed the assignment template, I commited this to the master branch, but I did not make any coding additions or edits to this template, you told me to add these 2 notices in so you would not mark me down for it on version control.
